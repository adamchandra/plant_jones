Plant Jones is a highly intelligent, semi-autonomous plant organism. He is capable of measuring, analyzing, and intelligently responding to his own moisture needs. This can be thought of as analagous to the 'thirst' behavior exhibited in vertebrates. 

Plant Jones also possesses highly developed social skills. He is able to parse tweets from human users and determine their sentiment. He uses these analyzed tweets to transmit information about his own 'thirst' levels in an appropriate manner.
